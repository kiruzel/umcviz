          After the record floods of 1997, communities all along the Red River took different approaches to protecting themselves from floods. Floodwaters had spread over large areas of Grand Forks and East Grand Forks, 60,000 people were out of their homes and downtown Grand Forks was burning. Even cities miles away from the Red River need protection such as Crookston on the Red Lake River, which feeds into the Red River. Moreover, in June 2008, the levees of the Mississippi River were breached by a large flood. More than 22 breached levees flooded many areas along the River in several days with 24 fatalities; thousands of people were affected and lost their homes, many industries and farmers in 51 counties of 5 states (Illinois, Missouri, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Minnesota) lost their products and ability to recover. Catastrophic flooding is a major security concern in the United States. Failure of dams, levees and flood gates of water infrastructures such as reservoirs, lakes, rivers and coastal water will cause losses of many lives, billions of dollars in property damage and environment degradations. Although most of the rivers are confined within manmade levee systems, these infrastructures are in great need to be improved and strengthened. 
The need for flood prediction and risk assessment is increasing and decision makers still lack intelligent tools to study flooding. Indeed, flooding are complex natural phenomena which are highly constrained by the geospatial environment. In order to study flooding, a number of challenges need to be addressed: (1) we need to reproduce and simulate such phenomena in a virtual environment using computer simulation; (2) we need to analyze large amount of data representing collected observations for frequent pattern discovery and flood prediction purposes; and (3) we need to geo-visualize and assess risks entailing potential flooding phenomena.
Advances in artificial intelligence evolved the geo-simulation paradigm for the modeling and simulation of complex natural phenomena. In addition, data mining which is concerned of new knowledge discovery from large databases can be applied to analyze the collected observations such as: flood history, water levels, snow-fall amounts, weather conditions, and geospatial data. Moreover, virtual reality provides nowadays techniques that enabled accurate geo-visualization of large scale environments. The integration of the aforementioned techniques within a simulation platform aims to support flood prediction and risk assessment.
In this research project, we propose to build a computer simulation platform to support flood prediction and risk assessment using advanced geo-visualization and data mining techniques. We intend to collect and analyze observation data in order to identify frequent patterns and to discover important relationships between the data variables using prediction models that we propose to build. These models will be integrated in a Geo-Simulation platform which offers 3-D geo-visualization to help decision makers predict potential floods and assess associated risks. This platform aims to leverage the unique virtual immersion facilities available at the University of Minnesota Crookston (UMC).
The goal of this research project is to help the local community at Crookston for better flood prevention planning. We believe that the proposed platform and associated set of models and algorithms will be of the interest for the elaboration of effective strategic flood prevention planning. We first target local areas Red-Lake Valley or Red River as a case study but we anticipate that our geo-simulation platform can be adapted to other geographic areas. Upon success, this research project will open perspectives for external funding considering the project outcomes and significance.

Flood models are a major tool for mitigating the effects of flooding (Gouldby, et al., 2008). They provide predictions of flood extent and depth that are used in the development of spatially accurate hazard maps (Goodchild, 2006). Predictive models allow the assessment of risk to life and property and the prioritization of either the maintenance of existing flood defences or the construction of new ones (Mioc, et al., 2007). Computer simulation and geo-visualization techniques enable the study of such scenario. In this section, we provide the present state of work in the field of predictive modeling, flood modeling and simulation using GIS data. 
Predictive modeling (supervised learning) has been widely studied for broad number of application such as: medical diagnoses (Margoosian & Abouei, 2013), classifying web services (jie & Jian, 2012), and fraud detection (Alowais & Soon, 2012). The need of flood prediction models is of the highest importance since it critically impacts the life of people and their properties. In the past few years, several flood prediction models have been proposed. A web GIS system has been developed in (Mioc, et al., 2007) for decision support. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) with fuzzy theory has been used in (Corani & Guariso, 2005) to enhance flood predictions. A model based on support vector machines has been created in (Li, et al., 2012) to predict flood velocity. A model to predict flood occurrences patterns (Ku, et al., 2009) is presented. A series of data mining techniques has been proposed in (Damle & Yalcin, 2006) for flood prediction. 
There have been significant advances in flood modeling over the past decade. Progress has been made in the understanding of the processes controlling runoff and flood wave propagation, in simulation techniques, in uncertainty handling and risk assessment, and in the collecting and analyzing of data (Dawson, et al., 2011). 
The flood phenomenon is highly constrained by the spatial environment in which it takes place (Goodchild, 2006). Existing analytical models usually fail to capture the interaction between this phenomenon and the geospatial environment in which it evolves (Mauro & Bruijn, 2012). The movement of flood waters through the landscape can be approximated using many different methods. Describing natural physical phenomena using numerical methods requires making broad assumptions to develop governing equations (Mioc, et al., 2007). While simple hydraulic modeling methods may be sufficient for approximating propagation of flood peaks through river channels,  more complex hydraulic analyses may be necessary to incorporate effects of infrastructure (i.e. bridge, building, roads, etc.) or complex overland flow (Goodchild, 2006). 
There are several well-known methods to assess the impact of the flood to the urban areas. Some of them consider the economic effects of flooding (Gouldby, et al., 2008), while others focus on estimation of the number of fatalities (Dawson, et al., 2011) (Mauro & Bruijn, 2012) (Mauro & Lumbroso, 2008). Some of these use empirical models which try to predict the number of casualties by some heuristic rules. For example (Mauro & Bruijn, 2012) uses numerical flood simulation to estimate the flood characteristics (depth, flow speed and so on) in the modeled area. They apply an empirical formula to estimate the fraction of fatalities (mortality function) for each spatial location. Given the initial population distribution this can provide a useful estimate of the number of loss of life events. 
Some authors use agent-based modeling (ABM) to employ more details of population behavior into the simulation. For example (Dawson, et al., 2011) uses ABM to model the cycle of daytime routines being interrupted by a flood. The authors consider the case of vehicle evacuation over a road network. The Life Safety Model (Mauro & Lumbroso, 2008) is another agent-based model of flood evacuation; it uses a sophisticated set of rules to predict loss-of-life events depending of agent’s health condition and actual location (building, vehicle, pedestrian). 
Although, several flood prediction models have been proposed, none of these models has been adapted to take into account the characteristics of the geospatial environment. In addition, none of the aforementioned models integrates GIS data and supports agent-based geo-simulation with geo-visualization that enables “what if analysis”.
Geospatial environments are usually complex and large-scale, the creation of computer generated virtual geospatial environments is difficult and needs large quantities of geometrical data originating from the environment characteristics (terrain elevation, location of objects and agents, etc.) as well as semantic information that qualifies space (building, road, park, etc.)  (Mekni, 2013). Most of current agent-based simulation models consider the environment as a monolithic structure, which considerably reduces the capacity to handle large-scale, real world geographic environments as well as agent’s spatial reasoning capabilities (Lin & Batty, 2011). These models do not take into account the valuable semantic information associated with the geospatial features (Goodchild, 2006). The complexity of building such a description should only depend on the geometrical complexity of the geospatial environment rather than on its scale (Benenson & Torrens, 2004).

In this research project, we propose to build a computer simulation platform to support flood prediction and risk assessment using advanced geo-visualization and data mining techniques. First, we introduce the data mining concept. Next, we provide an overview on multi-agent geo-simulation techniques. 
Data mining (DM), also known as knowledge discovery from data (KDD) is the process of extraction interesting non-trivial, previously unknown patterns or knowledge from large amount of data. Classification is one major task in DM and has been widely used for predictive modeling. Classification consists of two main steps: first, establishing the classifier model through supervised learning. This model is trained using historical data. Second, the classification model is evaluated using accuracy measure. The accuracy is measured by splitting the data into two sets, testing and training. This model will be consulted to predict the testing data class labels. This model then can be used to predict new instances once it is accurate enough (at least 80% accuracy).  Association Rule Mining (ARM) is another task in data mining of discovering interesting relationships and patterns between variables in a large database. ARM is well known for market-basket analysis which is a modeling theory states that, based on historical data, if you buy a set of items, you  are most likely to buy another group of items. The discovered rules can be evaluated using the support (proportion of transactions in the data which contains the item set) and confidence (percentage value that shows the rule head frequency among all groups containing the rule body).
The aforementioned general data mining tasks can be adapted to our problem statement for potential flood prediction. We will collect historical data about the red-lake river valley. The collected data will be used to train several classifier models such K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees (DT) and Bayesian Networks (BN). Those classifiers will be evaluated and if accurate enough, they can be used for potential flooding.
In addition, we will use association rule mining theory to find the most interesting patterns that relate to higher probabilities for folding. We will analyze all parameters and establish rules, using Apriori and Frequent Pattern (FP) Growth Algorithms. The derived rules will be evaluated using standard support and confidence measures.
In this research, we propose to build multi-agent geo-simulations which enable autonomous agents’ spatial reasoning capabilities for flood analysis. Our approach relies on accurate and reliable vector format data provided by Geographic Information Systems (GIS) (Goodchild, 2006). This research program builds, in part, on top of outcomes of the research work carried on in (Mekni, 2013) and which evolved the concept of automated generation of semantically-informed virtual geographic environments populated with spatially-reasoning agents. It also leverages the new facilities provided by the UMC especially the immersive visualization and informatics lab which features advanced technology to create 3D simulations with applications across many disciplines including software engineering, physical and biological sciences, agriculture and natural resources.

The study of flood prediction and risk assessment is widely recognized as an interdisciplinary research which pushes fields such as computer simulation and data mining forward and accelerates scientific discovery. The proposed research project transcends the scope of a single discipline or program such as software engineering and information technology management. Our research project is located at the intersection of different disciplines including data analysis and knowledge discovery, computer simulation, artificial intelligence, geospatial and geomatics, and visualization, to name a few. We strongly believe that the integration of research and education through interdisciplinary projects prepares students to undertake scientific challenges in innovative ways.  
Flood prediction and risk assessment using computer simulation and involving data mining techniques is an emergent research field and a promising paradigm for the study of complex dynamic phenomena and decision-support purposes. A limited amount of research work has been carried out in this respect. On success, it will be a step forward in modeling and simulation of dynamic phenomena in geo-spatial environments using advanced data mining approaches. It is anticipated that the set of tools, algorithms and applications obtained from this research program will help external funding sources such as NSF, and establish research partnership with governmental and private organizations. We already identified the following potential funding sources: Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, Polk County, and ND Citizens for Responsible Flood Control organization.
We anticipate a large knowledge dissemination of the obtained results and experimentations. We target the following peer-reviewed journals and international conferences:

    <li>Natural Hazards </li>
    <li>Journal of Flood Risk Management </li>
    <li>International Journal of Systems & Applications in Computer Graphics</li>
